The simplest use of <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.</p>\n\n<p>2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via class attribute. Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/cssSelector\">cssSelector</a> property.</p>\n\n<p>3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/xpath\">xpath</a> property.</p>\n\n<p>For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable.

For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure)."},{"class":"TVClip","properties":[{"description":"The subject matter of the content.","@dataType":["string"],"name":"about"},{"description":"The human sensory perceptual system or cognitive faculty through which a person may process or perceive information.
