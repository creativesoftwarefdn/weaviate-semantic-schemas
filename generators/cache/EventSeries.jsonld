  "rdfs:comment": "A series of <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Event\">Event</a>s. Included events can relate with the series using the <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/superEvent\">superEvent</a> property.</p>\n\n<p>An EventSeries is a collection of events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, \"The Olympic Games\" is a series, which\nis repeated regularly. The \"2012 London Olympics\" can be presented both as an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/Event\">Event</a> in the series \"Olympic Games\", and as an\n<a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/EventSeries\">EventSeries</a> that included a number of sporting competitions as Events.</p>\n\n<p>The nature of the association between the events in an <a class=\"localLink\" href=\"http://schema.org/EventSeries\">EventSeries</a> can vary, but typical examples could\ninclude a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers.</p>\n\n<p>EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without\nworrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries\nmay seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but\nit may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.",
